# RAG Engine Demo Video Script (7-8 minutes)

## ðŸŽ¬ Video Structure & Timing

### 1. Introduction & Architecture Overview (1 minute)
**Screen**: Show README architecture diagram
**Script**: 
"This is a production-ready RAG Engine that asynchronously ingests web content and enables AI-powered question answering. The system uses FastAPI for the REST API, Celery workers for background processing, Redis for queuing and caching, PostgreSQL for metadata, Qdrant for vector storage, and Ollama with Llama 3.2 for answer generation."

**Show**: Point to each component in the architecture diagram

### 2. System Startup & Health Check (30 seconds)
**Screen**: Terminal showing startup
**Actions**:
```bash
./start_dev.sh
```
**Script**: 
"Starting the development environment with all services. This includes Redis, PostgreSQL, Qdrant vector database, the FastAPI server, Celery worker, and Streamlit frontend."

**Show**: Services starting up, then navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs

### 3. API Documentation Demo (30 seconds)
**Screen**: FastAPI Swagger UI
**Script**: 
"The system provides comprehensive API documentation with interactive endpoints for URL ingestion, querying, and status monitoring."

**Show**: Expand `/api/ingest-url` and `/api/query` endpoints briefly

### 4. URL Ingestion Workflow (2 minutes)
**Screen**: Split between Streamlit frontend and terminal/logs

#### 4a. First URL Ingestion
**Actions**:
- Open Streamlit frontend (http://localhost:8501)
- Ingest URL: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence`
- Show status: "pending" â†’ "processing" â†’ "completed"

**Script**: 
"Let's ingest our first URL about Artificial Intelligence. The system immediately returns a 'pending' status while processing happens asynchronously in the background."

**Show**: 
- Celery worker logs processing the URL
- Content extraction and chunking
- Vector embeddings being stored in Qdrant

#### 4b. Content Change Detection
**Actions**:
- Try to ingest the same URL again
- Show "Content unchanged, skipped processing" message

**Script**: 
"When we try to ingest the same URL again, the system detects that content hasn't changed using hash comparison and skips reprocessing - this saves significant computational resources."

### 5. Query & Search Demonstration (2.5 minutes)

#### 5a. Basic Query
**Screen**: Streamlit query interface
**Actions**:
- Query: "What is machine learning?"
- Show AI-generated answer with sources

**Script**: 
"Now let's query our knowledge base. The system embeds the question, searches for relevant content chunks in Qdrant, and generates a comprehensive answer using the local Llama model."

**Show**: 
- Relevant sources with URLs and relevance scores
- Generated answer quality

#### 5b. Complex Query
**Actions**:
- Add another URL: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning`
- Wait for processing
- Query: "Compare machine learning and deep learning approaches"

**Script**: 
"After ingesting content about deep learning, we can ask more complex questions that require information synthesis from multiple sources."

**Show**: Answer drawing from both ingested articles

#### 5c. Query with No Results
**Actions**:
- Query: "What is quantum computing?"

**Script**: 
"When asking about topics not in our knowledge base, the system gracefully indicates no relevant information is available."

### 6. Monitoring & Status (1 minute)

#### 6a. Status Dashboard
**Screen**: Streamlit status section
**Actions**:
- Show ingestion statistics
- Display processing queue status

**Script**: 
"The system provides real-time monitoring of ingestion status, showing pending, processing, completed, and failed URLs."

#### 6b. API Health Check
**Screen**: Browser or curl
**Actions**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

**Script**: 
"Health endpoints monitor all system components including the vector database and LLM availability."

### 7. Production Features Demo (1 minute)

#### 7a. Caching Performance
**Screen**: Terminal with timing
**Actions**:
- Show first query timing
- Repeat same query to show cache hit

**Script**: 
"The multi-layer caching system dramatically improves performance for repeated queries, with embedding and content caches reducing response times."

#### 7b. Error Handling
**Actions**:
- Try invalid URL: `https://invalid-url-that-does-not-exist.com`
- Show graceful error handling

**Script**: 
"The system handles errors gracefully, updating status to 'failed' with descriptive error messages while continuing to process other URLs."

### 8. Architecture Benefits & Wrap-up (30 seconds)
**Screen**: Back to architecture diagram
**Script**: 
"This RAG Engine demonstrates production-ready features: asynchronous processing, intelligent caching, comprehensive monitoring, and scalable microservices architecture. The system can handle concurrent URL processing while providing immediate API responses and accurate, source-attributed answers."
